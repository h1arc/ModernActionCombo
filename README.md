> **Modern High-Performance Action Resolver for FFXIV**  
> Ultra-fast combo system with modern .NET 9 optimizations. Built from the ground up for performance and simplicity.

## What is ModernActionCombo?

**ModernActionCombo** is a clean-slate, ultra-high-performance action resolver for Final Fantasy XIV that consolidates combos and abilities onto single buttons with sub-50ns resolution times.

This is a **complete rewrite** focusing on:
- **Performance**: Sub-50ns action resolution with zero allocations
- **Simplicity**: Clean architecture that's easy to understand and extend  
- **Reliability**: Button mashing protection and comprehensive testing
- **Modern .NET**: Leveraging .NET 9's latest performance optimizations

### Thanks

This project was very much inspired by [WrathCombo team](https://github.com/PunishXIV/WrathCombo)'s WrathCombo. I wanted to see how far I could push a system like this.
